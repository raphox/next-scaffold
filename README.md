# next-scaffold

The gem [next_rails_scaffold](https://github.com/raphox/next-rails) uses this repository to generate the page routing system to consume the RESTful API generated by the command `bin/rails generate scaffold Post title:string body:text`.

To get more information about the page routing system and the static export for Next.js, access https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports.
To learn more about the Rails scaffold generator, access https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#bin-rails-generate.

> **Attention:** This package is a flexible and extensible project template that can consume any RESTful API, regardless of the backend technology used. While the sample application is integrated with a Ruby on Rails API, the project is not limited to it. You can easily connect it to any other RESTful service, making it adaptable to various backend implementations.
